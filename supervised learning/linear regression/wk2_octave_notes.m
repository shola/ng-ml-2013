% A .* B ---> multiplies each element in A by each element in B, given they have the same dimss
% [val, ind] = max(A) ---> returns the value and index of the largest element in A
% A < 3 ---> yields a matrix/vector of the same shape as A, with a 1 or 0 in each location
% [r, c] = find(A >= 7) ---> returns 2 vectors with the rows and cols of the matching items
% sum(A) ---> adds of all elements of A
% what is sum(sum(A)) for?
% prod(A) ---> returns the product of all elements of A
% floor(A) ---> rounds down all elements of A
% ceil(A) ---> rounds up all elements of A
% max(A, [], 1) ---> returns a nx1 matrix of the max value in each column of A (use 2 for per-row max)
% max(max(A)) ---> returns the max value of the entire matrix
% A(:) ---> converts A to a vector
