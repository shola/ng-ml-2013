Hi Mike,

Below is a lead we have at NVIDIA. I originally sent it to Bret as I wasn't sure who looked after what area. We haven't heard anything from Lim since we submitted the quote.

Thanks,

Hi Bret,

This is the opportunity we have having the bay area.

Lim used to work with us at Oryx in Fremont. We believe the competition to be the Megatrace. Lim wouldn't say who else was quoting. It seems to be a need though.

Cheers,

Roger

Hi Lim,

Sorry I was not able to meet with you last week. We reviewed your requirements for a VI tester and I have attached a quote.

Please let me know if you have any questions at all.

Best regards,

Hi Lim,

Any update on getting together? We'd ideally need to chat before we can start work on the quote.

Hi Lim,

Thanks for the opportunity to quote. We would ideally need more detail to be able to get you a detailed quote. Would you be able to meet for lunch next week to discuss? We haven't seen you for a while so it would be nice to catch up.

Evan and Justin are both in Europe next week so it would be myself, Kyle and Jorge. Would Tian be able to join us too?

It looks like our schedule is open next week although I would not be able to make Friday.

Hopefully see you soon.

Regards,

Roger

Hi Roger,

Sorry I did not get back to you sooner. My manager had just given me his requirement, 1400 pins VI tester. The pin count is just a reference, as long it somewhere around 1400, we are good.

Could you provide me a quote for such tester? Thanks.


Best Regards,

Chor Tiong Lim
